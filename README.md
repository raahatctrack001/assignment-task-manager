## 📣 Note for Recruiters

This project was built as part of a pre-hire technical assessment.
It demonstrates skills in:

* TypeScript-based React architecture
* Local state and localStorage persistence
* Clean, modular component structuring
* Context API for global state
* Dark mode implementation using Tailwind `dark:` variants
* Protected route handling
* Date manipulation with date-fns
* Responsive and mobile-first design

I'd be glad to walk through the code or extend the project further in future iterations!
